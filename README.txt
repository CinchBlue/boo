COMPILING INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------

To compile this, use TDM-GCC MinGW.

Unfortunately, I had to dynamically link so things may not be that good.

Sorry, Rapptz, I couldn't use Sol.

I have a makefile to compile already. All resources are in place.
Assuming you have (mingw32-g++ and mingw32-make)...

do this:

mingw32-make dynamic

You should be able to play now.
